### 2025-12-24 <Badge type="tip" text="v1.0.6" />
- Fix bug

---

### 2025-12-13 <Badge type="tip" text="v1.0.5" />
- Fix: Modified BlurNative.java to use a static, shared ExecutorService
- Fix: Added a `setDownsampleFactor(float)` API and a corresponding XML attribute `app:downsampleFactor`
- Update blur view components to handle overlapping scenarios
- Integrated Glide: New `com.qmdeve.blurview.transform.glide.BlurTransformation`, Realizing Glide BitmapTransform The extension of ation supports BitmapPool to ensure efficient memory management and correct disk cache keys.
- Integrated Picasso: Add `com.qmdeve.blurview.transform.picasso.BlurTransformation` to implement the Transformation interface, Bitmap recycling has been properly handled.
- Configurable blur effect: Both integration methods support the configuration of blur radius and rounded corner radius.
- Fixed the resource leakage problem of BlurNative, and avoided repeated instantiation by changing it to a static shared instance.
- Added an empty check to Glide's BitmapPool.get() call to enhance the robustness of the application.
- Improved error handling and debugging logic.
- Skip thread overhead for single-core devices in Java layer
- Replace VLA with heap allocation in native code to prevent stack overflow
- Remove unnecessary alpha channel clamping in blur calculations
- BaseBlurView now automatically detects SurfaceView and calls setZOrderMediaOverlay(true) to ensure proper Z-ordering for blurring.
- Adds informative logs when a SurfaceView is configured and provides warnings for potential issues (e.g., API level < 24).
- Checks if the SurfaceView's surface is valid before attempting PixelCopy to prevent crashes.
- Enhances error handling for PixelCopy failures, with retries for transient errors like ERROR_SOURCE_NO_DATA.
- Adds detailed logging for PixelCopy successes and failures to aid debugging.
- Performance: Move PixelCopy operations to dedicated handler thread
- Fully rewrote the measurement logic to correctly handle margin and size measurements for subviews
- Support for android:layout_gravity has been added, allowing subviews to be precisely positioned within a parent container
- The previous version's sub-view layout positioning function was limited, which has been resolved
- The issue of not supporting complex layout requirements has been resolved
- The measurement logic is not perfect, which has been resolved
- Enhancement: Check the LayoutParams type of the subview when measuring
- New: If it is not LayoutParams type, it will automatically convert and set back to sub-views.
- Improvement: Make sure that all sub-views use the correct LayoutParams type
- Improvement: Re-measure only when the available space is different from the current measurement size
- Optimization: avoid unnecessary re-measurement and improve performance
- Enhancement: More accurate handling of FILL_HORIZONTAL and FILL_VERTICAL Gravity
- Improvement: Corrected the calculation logic of the sub-view position
- Optimization: Safer boundary inspection
- Optimization: Ensure that the sub-view does not exceed the boundary of the parent container
